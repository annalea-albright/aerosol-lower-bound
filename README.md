**Data availability:** Historical observed global-mean surface temperatures are from [Cowtan and Way, 2014, version 2.0](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/coverage2013/series.html). IPCC AR5 [effective radiative forcing data, Table AII.1.2](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2017/09/WG1AR5_AnnexII_FINAL.pdf) are from [Myhre et al 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf). Transient effective aerosol forcing data from the RFMIP experiment in CMIP6 were accessed at [ESGF](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/). Sulfur dioxide, black carbon, and organic carbon data are from [Hoesly et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-369-2018-supplement).

**Abstract:** A variety of empirical estimates have been published for the lower bounds on aerosol radiative forcing, clustered around -1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> or -2.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The reasons for obtaining such different constraints are not well understood. In this study, we explore bounds on aerosol radiative forcing using a Bayesian model of aerosol forcing and Earth's multi-timescale temperature response to radiative forcing. A joint inference of climate sensitivity and effective aerosol radiative forcing from historical surface temperatures since 1850 yields a maximum likelihood estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.7°C (5-95% c.i. 1.8 to 6.7°C) and an effective anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing of -0.70 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (5-95\% c.i. -1.2 to -0.33 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). The wide range of equilibrium climate sensitivity reflects difficulty in empirically constraining multi-decadal and longer-term responses using the instrumental record of surface temperature, as has been noted previously. A relatively tight bound on aerosol forcing is nonetheless obtained from the structure of temperature and aerosol precursor emissions, principally the rapid growth in precursor emissions between 1950--1980. Uncertainty in effective volcanic forcing contributes little uncertainty to effective anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing because their time-variable contributions weakly co-vary. Obtaining a -2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 5-percentile aerosol forcing lower bound would require prescribing internal climate variance that is a factor of four larger than found in simulations and a comparable variance in global temperature observations. Ocean heat uptake observations may further constrain aerosol radiative forcing but require a better understanding of the relationship between time-variable radiative feedbacks and net radiative forcing.
